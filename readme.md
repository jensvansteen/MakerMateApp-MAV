# MakerMate

Design For everyone is an interdisciplinary living lab from Hogeschool West-Flanders where students Occupational therapy and Industrial Product Design work together to create personalized tools for people with disabilities. For my thesis, I got the challenge to bring this concept to the public as a self-sustaining platform. The solution me and my teammate worked out for this was a mobile application where makers and occupational therapist get guided and can collaborate in creating tools on request from people. This by providing functionalities for communication, step by step guidance and documentation.

The is the source code of the prototype that was built.
